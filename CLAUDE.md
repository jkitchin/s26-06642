# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **06-642: Data Science and Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering** - a half-semester course at Carnegie Mellon University (Spring 2026). It's a Jupyter Book-based educational platform with interactive learning components including gamification (badges, ranks) and narrative characters.

**Published at**: https://jkitchin.github.io/s26-06642/

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (uses uv package manager)
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Build the Jupyter Book
jupyter-book build dsmles

# Launch Jupyter Lab for development
jupyter lab
```

The book is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/build-book.yml` on push to main.

```

## Key Patterns

### Datasets
- All datasets are in `dsmles/data/` as CSV files
- Generated by `generate_datasets.py` and `generate_assignment_datasets.py`
- Use `np.random.seed(42)` for reproducibility
- Assignment notebooks load data from GitHub raw URLs for Colab compatibility

### Notebook Structure
- Lecture notebooks include Colab badges, learning objectives, code examples, and section quizzes
- Use notebook tags: `skip-execution`, `remove-cell` for processing control
- Quizzes stored in `quizzes/` subdirectories as JSON

### Jupyter Book Configuration
- Auto-executes notebooks on build (300s timeout)
- Intersphinx mapping for NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn documentation cross-references
- BibTeX citations enabled

## Dependencies

Core: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pycse, shap, xgboost, umap-learn

Optional extras in pyproject.toml:
- `llm`: OpenAI, Anthropic integration
- `deep-learning`: PyTorch
- `symbolic`: PySR symbolic regression

## Git Rules

- Never use `--no-verify` with git commits
