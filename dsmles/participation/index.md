# In-Class Participation Exercises

Active learning activities designed for use during lectures. Each module includes 3 exercises of varying types to promote engagement and deeper understanding.

## Exercise Types

| Type | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Reflection** | Personal reflection connecting concepts to experience | 3-5 min |
| **Mini-Exercise** | Hands-on coding or problem solving | 5-10 min |
| **Discussion** | Pair or group discussion with neighbors | 5-7 min |
| **Prediction** | Make predictions before seeing results | 2-3 min |
| **Critique** | Analyze code, results, or identify bugs | 5-7 min |

| 13: Model Interpretability | 13.1-13.3 | Stakeholder explanations, SHAP interpretation, right to explanation |

## How to Use

1. **Before class**: Review the exercises for the day's module
2. **During class**: Pause at designated points for each exercise
3. **After exercises**: Brief whole-class discussion or share-out
4. **Participation credit**: Students complete exercises in their own copy

## Grading Suggestions

- **Completion-based**: Check if students attempted each exercise
- **Effort-based**: Brief instructor review of quality
- **Peer review**: Students review each other's responses
- **Random selection**: Grade a subset of exercises each week
