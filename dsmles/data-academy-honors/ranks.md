## Notes for Success

### Start Early
Don't wait until the last week to attempt badge activities. The quizzes and activities build on each other.

### Document Everything
Keep a running notebook of your analyses. This becomes your portfolio and makes capstones easier.

### Ask for Help
Characters like Query Quinn remind us: asking good questions is a sign of strength, not weakness.

### Connect to Your Research
The most meaningful projects connect data science to problems you care about in chemical engineering.
