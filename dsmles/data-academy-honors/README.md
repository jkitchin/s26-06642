# Data Academy Honors

A recognition program for demonstrating mastery of data science and machine learning concepts. Complete badges to earn ranks and show your expertise as a Data Detective.

---

## Program Overview

**Mission:** Recognize students who go beyond the basics to demonstrate true understanding of data science concepts and their application to chemical engineering problems.

**Timeline:** Designed to be achievable within one semester

**Philosophy:** Like a detective earning credentials, each badge and rank represents demonstrated skill in investigating data, building models, and communicating findings responsibly.
