    "- Uncertainty quantification\n",
    "- Model interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load, clean, and manipulate data using Pandas\n",
    "2. Visualize data effectively using Matplotlib\n",
    "3. Build and evaluate regression models\n",
    "4. Apply cross-validation and regularization to prevent overfitting\n",
    "5. Use ensemble methods for improved predictions\n",
    "6. Perform clustering and dimensionality reduction on complex datasets\n",
    "7. Quantify uncertainty in model predictions\n",
