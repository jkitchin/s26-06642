    "\n",
    "This course introduces data science and machine learning techniques with applications to chemical engineering problems. We emphasize practical implementation in Python, focusing on tools and methods that are directly applicable to research and industrial practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics include:\n",
    "- Data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas\n",
    "- Regression and classification with scikit-learn\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction and clustering\n",
    "- Ensemble methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "- Uncertainty quantification\n",
    "- Model interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load, clean, and manipulate data using Pandas\n",
    "2. Visualize data effectively using Matplotlib\n",
    "3. Build and evaluate regression models\n",
    "4. Apply cross-validation and regularization to prevent overfitting\n",
    "5. Use ensemble methods for improved predictions\n",
    "6. Perform clustering and dimensionality reduction on complex datasets\n",
    "7. Quantify uncertainty in model predictions\n",
    "8. Interpret machine learning models to extract scientific insights\n",

    "The project is an opportunity to apply course techniques to a problem of your choice. Projects should:\n",
    "- Address a real chemical engineering or scientific problem\n",
    "- Use at least 3 techniques from the course\n",
    "- Include proper validation and uncertainty quantification\n",
    "- Be presented in a well-documented notebook\n",
