* Course Overview

This half-semester course covers practical applications of data science and machine learning techniques to problems in chemical engineering and related sciences.

** Topics Covered
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
- Linear and nonlinear regression
- Classification and clustering
- Ensemble methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)
- Uncertainty quantification
- Model interpretability (SHAP)

* Using Claude in This Course

This course encourages the use of Claude (and other AI assistants) as learning tools. Here's how to use them effectively:

** Recommended Uses
- *Explaining concepts*: Ask Claude to explain confusing topics in different ways
- *Debugging help*: Share error messages and ask for explanations
- *Code review*: Have Claude review your code and suggest improvements
- *Exploring alternatives*: Ask "What are other ways to solve this problem?"
- *Understanding documentation*: Get help interpreting scikit-learn or pandas docs

** Best Practices
1. *Try first*: Attempt problems yourself before asking for help
2. *Ask "why"*: Don't just copy code—ask Claude to explain the reasoning
3. *Verify*: Always test AI-generated code; it can have bugs
4. *Cite*: Acknowledge when AI assisted with your work
5. *Learn*: Use AI to accelerate learning, not replace it

** What to Avoid
- Submitting AI-generated work without understanding it
- Using AI during closed-book assessments
- Letting AI do all the thinking—you're here to learn!

* Interactive Learning

** Data Academy Honors
